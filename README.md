🩺 Heart Disease Predictor

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The model is built and trained using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

📌Overview

The Heart Disease Predictor analyzes patient data and predicts heart disease risk using supervised learning algorithms. This tool aims to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions and identify at-risk individuals early.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets
Training ML models for disease prediction
Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics
Exporting trained model for reuse
Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook
